## Test File 5: Comments Testing
## This file thoroughly tests single-line and multi-line comments

## Single-line comment at the start
## Another comment
## And one more

start
    ## Comment before code
    declare Value = 100  ## Comment after code
    
    ## Multiple single-line comments in a row
    ## Comment line 1
    ## Comment line 2
    ## Comment line 3
    ## Comment line 4
    
    declare Another_value = 200
    
    #* 
       This is a simple multi-line comment
       It spans multiple lines
       And should be completely ignored by the scanner
    *#
    
    declare Result = Value + Another_value
    
    #*
    Multi-line comment with different content:
    - Lists
    - Special characters: !@#$%^&*()
    - Numbers: 123456789
    - Code-like text: declare X = 100
    *#
    
    ## Comment before condition
    condition (Value > 0)  ## Comment after condition
        ## Comment inside block
        output "Value is positive"  ## Another inline comment
    finish  ## Comment after finish
    
    #* Compact multi-line comment *#
    
    declare Counter = 0
    
    #*
    This is a longer multi-line comment that demonstrates
    how our scanner handles comments with various content.
    
    It can contain:
    - Empty lines
    
    - Code that should not be executed:
      declare Fake_var = 999
      output "This should not print"
    
    - Keywords: start finish loop condition
    - Operators: + - * / == != && ||
    - Special characters: @#$%^&*()
    
    All of this should be completely ignored!
    *#
    
    loop (Counter < 5)
        ## Loop body comment
        Counter++
        #* Inline multi-line in loop *#
        output Counter
    finish
    
    ## Testing comments with edge cases
    
    #* Comment with asterisk * inside *#
    #* Comment with multiple * * * asterisks *#
    #* Comment with hash # inside *#
    #* Comment with *# sequence mentioned but not ending: *# fake *#
    
    ## Single-line comment with ## inside it ##
    ## Comment with special chars: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:'",.<>?/\
    
    declare Text = "This is not a comment: ##"  ## But this is!
    declare More_text = "Not a comment: #* *#"   ## This is a comment
    
    #*
       Comment explaining the next section
       ===================================
       We're going to test some complex expressions
    *#
    
    declare Complex = (Value * 2) + (Another_value / 2) - (Counter ** 2)
    
    function Test_function(Param_1, Param_2)
        ## Function comment
        #*
           This function demonstrates that comments work
           inside function bodies as well
        *#
        declare Local_var = Param_1 + Param_2
        return Local_var  ## Return value
    finish
    
    ## Comment before function call
    declare Func_result = Test_function(10, 20)  ## Comment after call
    
    #* 
    ========================================
    Section: Array Operations
    ========================================
    Testing comments in array sections
    *#
    
    declare Numbers[10]  ## Declare array
    Numbers[0] = 100     ## First element
    Numbers[1] = 200     ## Second element
    ## Numbers[2] = 300  ## Commented out assignment
    
    #*
    TODO: Add more array operations
    FIXME: Array bounds checking needed
    NOTE: This is just for demonstration
    *#
    
    ## Testing comment density
    ##
    ## Multiple empty comment lines
    ##
    ##
    
    #**#  ## Empty multi-line comment
    #*   *#  ## Multi-line with just spaces
    #*
    *#  ## Multi-line with just newline
    
    declare Almost_done = true
    
    ## Comment at different indentation levels
        ## Indented comment 1
            ## Indented comment 2
                ## Indented comment 3
    
    #*
        Indented multi-line comment
            with different levels
                of indentation
    *#
    
    condition (Almost_done)
        ## Comment in condition
        #* Multi-line in condition *#
        output "Test complete!"
        
        condition (true)
            ## Nested condition comment
            #* Nested multi-line *#
            output "Nested block"
        finish
    finish
    
    ## Very long single-line comment that goes on and on and on to test if the scanner can handle really long comments without any issues whatsoever regardless of how much text is in them
    
    #*
    Very long multi-line comment that also goes on and on
    with multiple lines of text to ensure that our scanner
    can properly handle long comments that span many lines
    without running into any buffer or memory issues.
    
    This comment contains multiple paragraphs and continues
    for quite a while to thoroughly test the comment handling
    capabilities of our lexical analyzer implementation.
    *#
    
    ## Final comment before end
finish  ## End of program

## Comments after main program block
## These should also be properly handled
## Even at the very end of the file

#*
Final multi-line comment at the end
This is the last comment in the file
*#

## Truly the last line
